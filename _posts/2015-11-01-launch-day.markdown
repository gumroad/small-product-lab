You made it! Today you're pulling the trigger on all your plans. Get out there and hustle, but don't forget to also take a moment to congratulate yourself! You've worked extremely hard to get to this point.

To-Do: #SPLLaunchDay
------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Launch

Release your product and execute your launch plan. This might include:

* Sending a note to your email list with your product link. If you already told them all the details of your product yesterday (like [Justin recommended](http://eepurl.com/bBI5Ej)), make this one short and sweet.
* Tweeting/Facebooking/posting on any social networks that you're active on.
* Writing a blog post about your product.
* Submitting (or getting friends to submit) your product link to relevant online communities.

### 2. Thank your supporters

Thanks fans individually via email and/or social media when they purchase. Retweet/reblog/favorite/like anyone that mentions you and your product. Show some love in the Facebook group(!). Make your supporters feel appreciated.

And finally...

### Celebrate! YOU DID IT!!!
